* Narrowed Page Navigation

=narrowed-page-navigation-mode= is a minor mode that provides
keybindings for showing only one page at a time. This is intended
to be useful primarily for presentations and live coding, where it
might be convenient to avoid distractions for the audience.

This is accomplished using Emacs's standard narrowing features. After
invoking =narrowed-page-navigation-mode=, begin narrowing to the
current page using =C-x n p=. Then, the default keybindings are:
 + =S-Up= :: Go to previous page
 + =S-Down= :: Go to next page

Remember that you can show the whole buffer again with =M-x widen= or
=C-x n w=.
